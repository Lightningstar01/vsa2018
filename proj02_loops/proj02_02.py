# proj02_02: Fibonacci Sequence

"""
Asks a user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and generates them. The Fibonacci 
sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the 
previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
